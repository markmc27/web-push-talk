# web-push-talk
A talk from the June 2018 Liverpool Umbraco meetup about how push notifications can be sent from a custom section in the Umbraco backoffice. The slides and code samples focus on the concepts and frontend code required for the user subscribe to notifications from the website. 

The server-side code for sending the push notifications is documented really well on the web-push-csharp repo: https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-csharp
